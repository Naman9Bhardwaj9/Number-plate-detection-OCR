# Number-plate-detection-OCR

The following impliments two approaches to solve the problem:
1) Deep learning approach:-
  a)Licence_plate_dataset:- to download and extract the dataset (can be done through kaggle kernels).
  b)Licence_plate_detection:- to detect the number plates in the images.
  c)Licence_plate_recognition:- to detect the characters and make predictions.
  
2) Light weight "Image processing" processing approach:
  a)Go to "/image-recog" and execute main.py to apply openCV along with tesseract to get the prediction.
